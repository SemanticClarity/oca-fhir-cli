00:39:38	Tom Jones:	The bulk of HL7 data is in xml not json today
00:40:29	Mukundan Parthasarathy:	There are open source options available to convert HL7 v2, R3 xml to R4 json if required. You could apply that at the front end of this pipeline
00:41:02	Tom Jones:	Right - I might be appropriate for interop to indicate which is tested
00:41:14	Josh Mandel:	Do you have examples of the inputs/outputs of this pipeline?
00:41:28	Mukundan Parthasarathy:	Yes, we'll cover this shortly
00:41:52	Josh Mandel:	Thanks! Is it possible to share this deck too?
00:46:45	Tom Jones:	I have mine own records - are these transforms available for me to test now
00:47:45	John Walker:	@Tom - for this work our target data format is JSON-LD, but one can also transform from XML to JSON-LD
00:48:10	Tom Jones:	Is the code where I can get it?
00:48:47	Tom Jones:	In particular the extraction of the appropriate reocrds
00:50:27	Tom Jones:	When you say there are different targets, does that mean different targets for the VP?  IE can there be a single VC
00:52:39	Tom Jones:	I don’t see how a travel credential could be region specific - that would work at both ends of the trip
00:52:56	John Walker:	@Tom - the extract queries are not included, but the queries would follow the requirements of the relevant IG guides per jurisdiction
00:53:20	Tom Jones:	So is there just one VC format?
00:53:38	Tom Jones:	That should not be region sepcific, right?
00:55:45	John Walker:	The VC’s are specific to supporting the jurisdiction spec
00:55:55	Tom Jones:	That won’t work
00:56:07	Tom Jones:	Not for travel
00:57:21	Paul Knowles:	The VC format should be the same. However, the underlying Records (database records) can be different depending on jurisdiction. For example, US capture CVX codes, EU does not.
01:01:03	Josh Mandel:	Re: inputs, have you looked at the Collection-type bundles we define for SMART Health Cards (e.g., https://smarthealth.cards/examples )?
01:03:18	Josh Mandel:	When it comes to interop across jurisdictions, you can either 1) expect verifiers to understand the source data, or 2) expect issuers to prepare VCs that are geared for specific verification scenarios -- or some hybrid. There are trade-offs here, but it's important to have reasonable defaults.
01:04:11	Tom Jones:	Right - I guess my point is the vc should collect all the data that MIGHT be use
01:05:19	Josh Mandel:	@Tom in a context where selective disclosure is supported, that's a good principle. But keep in mind that some users won't have smartphones and might just have a QR on a piece of paper they care -- so for them, you don't want to pack in "extra that that MIGHT be of use" because it can lead to coerced over-sharing.
01:05:30	Josh Mandel:	*carry, not "care".
01:05:46	John Walker:	@Josh - we have reviewed them, I’m sure we could go back for a review
01:06:18	Tom Jones:	I admit I am looking at smart phones - the other use case is way harder
01:06:54	Tom Jones:	Note that in mDL, the paper card MUST still be carried to be legal
01:07:47	Tom Jones:	There is no selective release on a paper copy other than what the verifier is trusted to do
01:10:19	Tom Jones:	No data transformation can output more information than was entered, so the transform needs to match the receiver requirements, not the sender
01:13:45	Tom Jones:	FHIR data is not necessarily all the clinical data - it has already been transformed
01:19:45	Josh Mandel:	But for *consuming* these credentials... what do you do, reverse the pipeline to map back to vanilla FHIR?
01:20:34	John Walker:	@Josh - That is the OCA “reconstitute” the application context
01:21:48	Tom Jones:	Are you aware of the HL7 doc http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ImmunizationFHIRDS/
01:21:58	Josh Mandel:	The thing that "breaks" is just when you have two systems that implement FHIR and a user wants to share credentials between them. the back-and-forth is hard, and a "tax".
01:27:22	Tom Jones:	And that already happens between the lab & her now
01:27:23	Josh Mandel:	(Thanks-- I should add it's not just about security domains; this exchange matters across boundaries.)
01:27:25	Tom Jones:	ehr
01:28:54	Josh Mandel:	It's important to note that the general mode of exchange is consumer-mediated; so EHR or health systems compliance obligations are much less relevant
01:29:05	Josh Mandel:	individuals have a right to access and re-share their own data as they choose.
01:30:14	PhilWolff:	be sure to save theh chat!
